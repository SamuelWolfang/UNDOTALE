### Discontinued :(
I sadly lost interest, don't really want to work on this anymore. Not alone, that is. If you wish to contribute, feel free to contact me or fork this!

# _UNDOTALE_
An UNDERTALE Engine recreated inside of Godot!

## What is UNDOTALE?
The main plan for this engine is to make it as accessible as possible in terms of modding.
The end result should allow anyone to modify a pre-made template (or create their own) for cutscenes, attacks and dialouge.
Basically Unitale, but with Godot and GDScript. You'll be able to make your own mods with the help of a GUI for development (contrary to Lua) and a plain simple simil-python programming language, very easy to understand and manipulate.

## What works at the moment?
As you may have guessed, the engine is not finished yet.
I semi-finished it a few months ago before deciding to abandon it and move on to other things.
I've started rewriting it from scratch a few weeks ago, and this is where we stand now:

| Mechanic | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| FIGHT | The basis for the turn-based system is there and it basically done. Cutscenes and Attacks need to be implemented, but those are for the user to decide. So the modding system needs to be finished for those to be working. |
| ACT | Same as for FIGHT, but the actual behaviour needs to be implemented as well. |
| ITEMs | The base for it is finished! They still need personalization, a stock list of items where to look from with relative sounds, and it should be done!|
| MERCY | Finished except for sound and animation. |
| OVERWORLD | Currently not in the works. I'm planning to start working on it once the battle engine is done.|

## Miscellaneous
| Feature | Status |
| ------ | ------ |
| SOULs | Blue and Red souls are implemented by default. The user will be able to add more! Blue soul needs to be patched up a little. |
| BOX and COLLISIONS | Both masking and collisions work pretty well! Without any shader of any kind. They're surely not 1:1 with UNDERTALE, since those used clamping and mine use actual collision shapes. Still, they work fine! |
| BOX RESIZING | Primal support was added! Can be resized only from the middle and the top left at the moment. Further directions will be added later. |
